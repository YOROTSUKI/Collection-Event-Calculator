This is a calculator designed to calculate the expenses incurred for collecting activities. It can help you quickly determine the total cost of achieving complete collection in a Collection event.

### How to use?

Simply input the Apex Coins and Crafting Metals you currently possess, then click calculate. It will help you determine the number of loot boxes, skins, and in-game currency you need to purchase.
